**Reflection:**  
What I have learned this week is the importance of cybersecurity. There are many different types of attacks and each attack has different strageties to deal with attacks. When
most people think of cybersecurity or hackers they think the stereotypical movie character where they are in a dark room with just the light of the computer screen typing away. 
But one big thing I always seem to underestimate is the inner accidental threats. The threats of poeple being simply people and making mistakes to leaving around sensitive information.
people can accidently leave passwords out or drop a paper with sensitive information on it. I think these are the everyday security threats in the workplace. Good habbits need to be 
taken in place to not just pay attention but secure and change passwords to making multi authentication processes.

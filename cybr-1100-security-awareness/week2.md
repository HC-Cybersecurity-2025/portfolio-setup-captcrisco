What Iâ€™ve learned from personal cyber risks and defenses is that attacks never stop. They are consistent with wanting your information and you need to be careful when doing anything like checking emails or logging into websites. 
Plenty of different attacks will be there to stop your computer, bogging your computer down, or holding your information for ransome. Being vigilant and understanding your computer's defensive powers are very important. My personal 
practices will always be reminding me to always watch what I'm clicking and what I'm reading. It's like texting and driving don't get distracted or comfortable.
